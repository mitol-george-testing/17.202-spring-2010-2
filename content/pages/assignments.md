Students were asked to complete two different types of assignments during the semester.

_Weekly one-page memos_ 
------------------------

Each memo will summarize an important theme raised in the preceding week's readings and propose a question or line of discussion to be pursued during the seminar. The one-page memos are due the day before class and must be distributed to all seminar participants beforehand.

 _**Four longer essays**_
-------------------------

Four additional essays are also required at various times throughout the semester. They should be four pages in length. You will take a week's readings and pose a general exam-like question that pertains to the reading. You will then write an answer to your question. I will grade the essay and return it to you for your revision, which you will complete by the end of the term.
